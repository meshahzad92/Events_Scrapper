"Happy Black Futures Month From Onika Powell, Artistic Director",2025-03-20,"The privilege many of us hold comes with the power to create real change. It’s not enough to simply acknowledge the issues and achievements—it’s also our responsibility to actively engage, educate ourselves, unlearn harmful systems, and create space for safety, equity, and creative expression. Using our influence to amplify Black voices and support Black artists is what we should take away from this month.   For those of you who are new to VIBE (and as a reminder to our long-time supporters), one of the ways we support the Black youth artists in our community is through our NExT program. In its sixth year, we continue to use mentorship and networking to empower Black youth artists across the GTA. The collaborative approach to our mentorship program has created pathways for exposure while working towards breaking down barriers and increasing visibility. As always, Black artists and allies alike, the success of this program relies on working together to create lasting change through funding/donations, access to networking opportunities and resources, as well as community support… so that means mark your calendars for March 20th as we launch Black Futures Exhibition 6.0. The event will showcase the powerful work of 10 Black Creatives, who truly deserve this spotlight and recognition. These artists are shaping the future, and we are inviting you to be part of their journey. With our partner TO Live, we will take over the Meridian Arts Centre to showcase this brilliance.

Tupac Shakur, a well know rapper who also died by gun violence once wrote a poem entitled The Rosses that Grew from Concrete. In this poem he argues that like a rose growing from concrete marginalized youth, even with their gifts are continuously viewed as ""broken"", ""sick"" and problematice. Such narratives about racialized/marginalized and Indigenous youth have led to not only stigmatization (criminal gang members), but control the so-called problem or threat. However, critical scholars including those with lived experience in the streets/gangs have argued that the narrative that has been created about gang/gang violence is not only inaccurate, but also inclomplete. As such the policies that have been designed to mitigate the issue, including criminal justice responses, have failed these youth.  This symposium seeks to address the following questions:  What is a gang? Why do youth join gangs? What are the mental health implications of gang membership and violence? How do youth survive/navigate the streets? How do youth exit gangs or a street life? What can practioners do?","Regent Theatre Ontario Tech  50 King Street East Oshawa, ON L1H 1B3 Canada",Free,https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/the-roses-that-grow-from-concrete-youth-gangs-and-gun-violence-symposium-tickets-1228160092899?aff=oddtdtcreator

Call for Interest: 2025 Workshop – Mothers’ Return to Work After Childbirth: Mental Health and Family Well-Being,2025-05-15,"Research shows that mothers’ earnings stagnate and often decrease following childbirth, leading to a large and growing gender pay gap. This is often referred to as the “motherhood penalty”. In response to this, considerable work has focused on policies which may facilitate the return of mothers to the workplace. However, knowledge remains scarce regarding the implications of the timing of this return on maternal mental health and on children’s development.    In a research project funded by the Vanier Institute of the Family, we seek to address this gap. In this context, we are organizing an workshop looking at various family structures, Indigenous parents, racialized parents, etc. If you are interested, please see the call for interest for more information.  At this stage, we are looking for individuals and organizations interested in participating in the workshop. These may include academic and non-academic researchers, policy makers, practitioners, etc. Individuals who wish to attend but not necessarily present may also contact us to receive updates.   Workshop Objectives:   Knowledge mobilization. Mothers’ return to work and maternal mental health are often considered separately in research and policy spaces. Our first objective is to address this; namely, to:  a) Bring together experts from various domains, including fields that have done more to bridge the gap between these two issues; and    b) Help further the conversation around the intersection of these topics.   Stakeholder engagement. With the expansion of affordable child care, the current policy context is a great opportunity for researchers to engage with policy makers and practitioners around:  a) What works best for families; and    b) How the expansion’s success could or should be evaluated going forward.   Conversation around data challenges and opportunities. Despite advances, important data gaps continue to restrict our ability to answer policy-relevant questions in this space. Our third objective is to engage with others to:  a) Identify the various data limitations individuals and organizations are facing; and   b) Discuss how existing data may be leveraged to circumvent some of these limitations.   Tentative Date and Location: The workshop will be held in Ottawa in the spring of 2025: May 15, 2025.   To express interest in participating in or attending the workshop, or for additional information, please email Dr. Simard-Duplain at gaelle.simardduplain@carleton.ca.

Fibre, ceramics, and sculpture illuminate the varied ways these artists approach the moon as inspiration. Working with themes of cyclicality, time, consistency, and ritual, Lunar Lore offers a journey through the many ways we know the moon, speaking to its universality of themes.  Cyclicality, circles, and spheres are central to the flow of the exhibition, encouraging the viewer to succumb to the natural pull of the lunar influence.

Evolution of therapies for myelofibrosis (MF): From palliation to disease modification,2025-02-25 16:00:00 - 2025-02-25 17:00:00,"Myelofibrosis (MF), a form of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), is a rare cancer where the bone marrow makes too many of one kind of blood cell. In MF, the abnormal cells cause normal bone marrow to be replaced by scar tissue. Over time, the fibrous scar tissue makes it harder for the bone marrow to produce normal blood cells. Fortunately, research into NMPs has meant that we are seeing an evolution in treatments and management.  In this 1-hour live webcast, Dr. Vikas Gupta, Hematologist at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, will review MF and the evolution in diagnosis, treatment options and aspects of follow-up care.
