Alongside Ocek, the fisher, and his band of animal friends, audiences take a dangerous expedition south to retrieve summer and return it to the frozen north. To the Plains Cree, Ocek was forever running across the night sky, ensuring the arrival of summer after the cold, perilous winter.  Learn how the great bully, the giant bear Mista Maskwa, was finally tamed by a brave band of birds. This adventure is mapped in the stars as the birds chase Mista Maskwa every night, keeping us safe from his foul temperament.

This 90 min webinar will allow key stakeholders, including people with lived experience of SCI (PLEX), hospital leadership, and clinicians, to learn about the new standard and principles behind its development. There will also be an interactive question and answer opportunity.  We hope you’ll join us as we start the conversation about the future of SCI accreditation in Canada.
